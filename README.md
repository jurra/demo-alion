## How it was done

I basically developed a component per day, and then integrated them. The focus in the first 2 days was on functionality, properly connecting vue components and getting the logic to work(form validation, child-parent component communication, etc).

The second iteration focused on styling, refactoring code, checking responsiveness and also adding a navbar to make the app look like a website.
